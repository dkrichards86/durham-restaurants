# WGU C207 Data-driven Decision Making Performance Assessment
As a performance assessment for WGU'S Data-driven Decision Making course, I
analyzed restaurant openings in Durham, North Carolina before and after 2012 to
quantify anecdotal evidence of increased entrepreneurship. For the sake of the
exercise, increased openings were attributed to hypothetical economic initiatives.

The application uses a Jupyter Notebook to conduct summary statistical analysis.
The notebook can be seen at [durham_restaurants.ipynb](durham_restaurants.ipynb).

See [the full analysis document](ANALYSIS.md) for more details.
